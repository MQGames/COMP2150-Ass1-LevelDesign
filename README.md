# COMP2150-Ass1-LevelDesign
The following template repository includes the 2D Game Kit provided by Unity, albeit with a few minor changes (in the form of additional prefabs). The 2D Game Kit will be used to create a simple platformer.



Your task is to design **three levels**. The requirements are:

1. Each level should take 2-3 minutes to play.

2. The levels should be of increasing difficulty.

3. 1. The first level should be a simple introduction to the core mechanics of the game.
   2. The second and third levels should be more challenging.

4. The complete set of levels should include all the elements listed above (although each level can include only a subset). You can also include other components from the 2D Game Kit, but this is not necessary.

5. Each level should contain three keys which are used to open the Hub Door and transition to the next level.
